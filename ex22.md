# Create a structure called `Volume` that use three variable of type `Distance` to model the volume of a room. Initialize a variable of type `Volume` to specific dimensions. To calculate the volume, convert each dimension type float representing `feet` and `inches` and then multiply the resulting three numbers.

# Solution

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    struct Distance{
        int feet;
        float inches;
    };

    struct Volume{
        Distance length;
        Distance width;
        Distance height;
    };

    int main(){
        float l, w, h;
        Volume room1 = {{16,3.5},{12,6.25},{8,1.75}};
        
        l = room1.length.feet + room1.length.inches/12;
        w = room1.width.feet + room1.width.inches/12;
        h = room1.height.feet + room1.height.inches/12;
        
        cout << "Volume = "<< l * w * h << " cubic feet"<<endl;
        
        return 0;

    }
